Thank you very much for the opportunity to do this assessment. It was a nice and interesting task.

I spent about 6 hours on this assessment due to tiny issues I encountered, but overall it was nice and simple.

Being a person who normally uses Material UI for the UI it was nice for a change to style everything myself. Managed to get all the tasks done as required. The most challenging part was when I was creating the CandidateList, because I did not use a (predefined) Table I had to come up with a way to style my table using DIVs, one of the downside about my method was the amount of styling added.

When I started the assessment I had a small planning process for a few minutes. I identified my components which are Candidate, CandidateList, Search and the standed APP which is on the highest level of all the components.

I started by adding all the components to App.js and displaying them using based on color to make it easier to start the project and know where to place everything.

I then built it by adding the logo first and went onto adding the search without the actual functionality and then the candidateList. After that I designed the candidate component and started adding solid functionality as that component would then be added onto the candidateList component to create the list. After that I added all the tiny bits and the app started flowing.

A few things I would have done better given more time is to make the app more responsive, I tried aligning the layout to the given design (https://www.figma.com/file/pde4nQEjUOIDPn7ZtM9KKf/Assignment%3A-Interview-Requests-(version-1.1)?node-id=0%3A1) . I also did not add any validation. There are no tests. I also would make the styling neater as I feel like its all over the place because I tried to complete the assessment as quick as possible. I also wanted to add a loader for when data is being updated. basically could have done a lot better with the styling.

As much as its a frontend assessment, it would have been nice to make an api call to fetch the data.
I think some clarity around using libraries would have been nice. 

Once again thank you very much, looking forward to hearing from you.

This application was build using VSCode! using the Create React App template.

To run the application:

## `npm install`
## `npm run start`

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
